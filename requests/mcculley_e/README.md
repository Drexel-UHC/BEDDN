### Request Details
**From email:**
1.	Usama and I developed a definition to classify NETS categories in the Healthcare Domain as “COVID relevant” in terms of COVID-19 mortality. We independently reviewed each category to classify as “COVID relevant” or “non-COVID relevant”. We agreed on 88.6% of the classifications, with 1 conflict (Kidney Centers, KTC). Can you please help us reach a consensus? The reviewer comments and definition are in the attached file.
2.	To complete classification for Combination Categories and Thematic Constructs, I need data corresponding to the 2019 counts for all Base Groups in the Healthcare category (either tract-level or county-level works). Can you please help me gain access to this data?
